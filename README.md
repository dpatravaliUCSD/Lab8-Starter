### Graceful Degradation and Service Workers
Graceful degration allows the software we build to hold up and function as we lose functionality. It is designed for high level functionality but provides fallback so that the software is still operative at lower functionality. Service workers can allow us to maintain functionality within our software so that we do something like go offline, our software still displays the necessary information without losing significant functionality.
